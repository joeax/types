# TypeScript Typings
Personal vault for TypeScript typings of various libraries that I use that have yet to embrace the power of TypeScript.

Note: I do not make pull requests to upstream repos per my personal policy, unless explicitly requested by the repo owner. If you wish to submit any of my typings
to DefinitelyTyped (need link) or to the original repo itself, I only ask you keep my name/GitHub username in the comments (per the MIT license)


## Using
Simply copy the file into your own project, preferably in a centralized `types` folder.


## Catalog
